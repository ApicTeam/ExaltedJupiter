## Build(without any ide)
1. For your platform copy **CMakeLists.txt._platform_** to **CMakeLists.txt**
2. Create **build** directory and cd into it
3. From console run `cmake ..` to configure the project according to CMakeLists.txt you made in the step before.
4. From console run `make` to actually build makefile prepared by step before and compile the executable.
5. Run **ExaltedJupiter_dev** executable with `./` or your preferred method and enjoy!
6. Create your branch! e.g. run `git branch yourbranchnamehere` then push your new branch with `git push origin yourbranchnamehere`
